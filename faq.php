                                       What Is RDP Or Remote Desktop Protocol?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-1">
                                        <p>Well, RDP, or you can say, Remote Desktop Protocol is originally designed and developed by Microsoft. In simple terms, RDP establishes the secure connection between two computers and allows users to access another computer with full multimedia support remotely. The purpose of RDP is to allow the end-user to control or work on any other system remotely. Radically, an RDP only needs an internet connection or a LAN cable to work. Overall, RDP is fully secure and does support SSL encryption.</p>

                                    <div class="accordion-section-title" data-tab="#accordion-2">
                                       Why You Need RDP?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-2">
                                        <p>Usually, RDP is used in a universal standard in organizations and said to be the best practice to provide connectivity. The main aim of RDP is to reduce the cost by providing remote access to users without compromising on the security aspects.</p>
                                    </div>
                                     <div class="accordion-section-title" data-tab="#accordion-3">
                                       How long will RDP account details be given after payment?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-3">
                                        <p>Generally all the RDP details sent INSTANT to upto 6 hours after payment confirmation. In some cases, if manual verification or custom configuration it may take upto 12 hours to 24 hours Max.</p>
                                    </div>

                                      Do you provide RDP with full admin access?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-4">
                                        <p>Yes, all our plans come with full admin access Private, at the moment we do not provide shared plans.</p>

                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-5">
                                        <p>Yes. We provide Control Panel To Manage RDP, You Can Restart, Shutdown, Reinstall OS, Reset and many more options.</p>

                                      What is the difference between Shared RDP and Admin RDP?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-6">
                                        <p>Shared RDP Plans do not have admin access, means you cannot install any software yourself, you have to request us to install that software for you, whereas Admin RDP plans are allowed to install softwares or do the work which requires admin permissions. Though having Admin privileges your capabilities are limited.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-title" data-tab="#accordion-7">
                                     Why DigiRDP plans are cheap? are they old and low performance servers?
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-7">
                                        <p>There are many reason why our RDPs are cheap (1.)We have our own hardware, we are not dependent on third party. (2.) We make less profit and offer good service to make our customers happy. (3.) We work remotely from home so we can save on office rent and make our services cheap. (4.) And we take many more steps to make our services cheap. Our hardware is latest and high-end, we have mentioned the hardware information on pricing table for more information.</p>

                                       What are the benefits of SSD Storage?

                                    <div class="accordion-section-content" id="accordion-10">
                                        <p>In I/O Benchmarking tests, SSD Dedicated Servers deliver twice as much speed as HDD. SSD doesn't require any moving parts to read or write data, in contrast to HDD. Microchips are used to store information instead. This variation accounts for how quickly SSD operates.</p>

                                        <p>A dedicated IP can be beneficial for a variety of reasons, including enabling access to your website when the DNS is not configured, enhancing performance during periods of heavy traffic volume, and enhancing security. A dedicated IP is essentially equivalent to having your own own online identification number.</p>

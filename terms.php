                                        <p>Indemnification
                                        The Subscriber shall indemnify and hold the Service Provider harmless against all third party claims, demands, suits, actions, judgments, losses, costs, damages (direct, indirect, and consequential), attorney’s fees and expenses that the Service Provider may sustain or incur by reason of any breach or alleged breach of any term or condition of this Agreement (including reasonable attorney’s fees) and for any act or omission of the Subscriber or customers of the Subscriber which are in any way related to the Service. While the Service Provider makes reasonable efforts to maintain the Service, many factors are not within the Service Provider’s control. Therefore, the Service Provider does not warrant, and is not responsible for (even if caused by negligence of the Service Provider) any loss of data, delays, non-delivery or miss-delivery of information, lack of access, slow response time, interruptions of the Service, or errors of the Service. Loss, delay or non-delivery of data can be due to but not limited to the Service Provider’s own negligence, viruses, or other third parties. The Subscriber’s data is defined as any data held by the Service Provider and includes account information, web hosting data, email, and domain name services. This disclaimer and waiver shall apply equally to any and all third party providers. The Service Provider makes no warranty to the Subscriber regarding the accuracy of usage statistics, which the Service Provider may provide at its discretion.

                                        Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. Any failure of the Service Provider to assert any rights it may have under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of the Service Provider’s right to assert the same or any other right at any other time or against any other person or entity. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be stricken from this Agreement without affecting the validity or enforceability of any other provision. The Service Provider may sub-contract any work, obligations or other performance required of the Service Provider under this Agreement without consent of the Subscriber. No part of this Agreement or in the understanding of the parties confers upon the parties the status of a partnership or joint venture. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Washington, without giving effect to applicable conflict of law’s provisions. The federal and state courts located in Seattle, Washington, USA alone have jurisdiction over all disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement and the Service. The Subscriber consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts sitting in Washington with respect to such matters or otherwise between the Subscriber and Service Provider, and waive rights to removal or consent to removal. In the event any litigation or other proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation or other proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in such litigation. The titles in this Agreement are provided only for convenience and are not to be used in interpreting the Agreement. The Service Provider reserves the right to change this Agreement upon notification sent by electronic mail to all active Subscribers.</p>

                            <p>Registering with RyzenRDP or subscribing to our service means you agree to our refund policy. We have enacted a refund policy to provide a better user experience, and the Policy is based on some guidelines and information that you should follow. Kindly read it carefully to avoid any issues that may arise. This Policy can be changed at any time with or without any notice. </p>
                            <p>To process the refund for RDP plans, we need a conclusive reason before you ask for a refund. The user must provide any definitive reason, we will try to resolve the issue, or a refund will be issued. You are no longer guaranteed a refund if you violate our TOS, we may still provide a partial refund, but we are not obligated to do so if you have done something atrocious.</p>
